# My C fun trainings

C is one of my all time favorite programming languages. Although the language has only a few use cases nowadays, I still try to write some simple apps with it every now and them because I believe it provides a deep understand of the topic. For example, if you learn how to manipulate files in C, then you probably don't have any issues doing the same using other programming languages because you understand exactly what's going on under the hood.
